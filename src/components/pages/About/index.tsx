      <H1>Aeons End Randomizer</H1>
      <P>
        <b>Aeons End Randomizer</b> is an unofficial companion app for the
        popular deck building game Aeons End. It helps you draw random mages,
        nemeses and supply cards (gems, relics, spells) and also provides a
        simulated turn order deck. You still need at least one Aeons End
        standalone box to actually play the game.
      </P>
      <P>
        To get started simply select which expansions you own and would like to
        use for randomization inside the settings. You can also disable specific
        cards/mages/nemeses inside the settings.

# Seeds

The seed makes each expeditions rolls completely deterministic. By importing/copying an existing expedition and re-using its seed each roll will be exactly the same as in the original provided that all parameters are unchanged and you perform exactly the same actions. That way you can try to beat your highscore or let other players enjoy a particular expedition by sharing your configuration.

## How does the import work?

The import of expedition configurations happens directly inside the expedition creation dialog.
You can either import a configruation from a `json` file or paste the configuration directly into
the provided textarea.

Upon clicking the `import` button the configuration will be validated and either show any
configuration errors or load the configuration. You can then progress with the expedition creation.

## How do I get a useful `settingsSnapshot`?

Writing out the `settingsSnapshot` can be quite a lot of work.
Currently the best way to get a good baseline would be as follows:

1. Select the content you want to include inside the AER settings
2. Create a regular expedition
3. From the expedition overview click the share button on the newly created expedition
4. You can now simply copy the settingsSnapshot from the shared/saved expedition and further configure it to your needs

## Where do I get the content ids?

All ids are displayed next to the content inside the settings.

## Is there an editor to create these configurations?

Unfortunately configurations currently have to be created by hand.
However we might build an expedition creator/editor in the future and maybe
even a plattform to share and rate expeditions. That is, if the community
doesn't create something themeselves ;)

_Note: Don't consider this to be a promise, but rather a slight possibility we might build something._

## Where can I find expeditions to import?

There currently is no single address to find expeditions (see question above).
However we expect to find expeditions over on the [forums on board game geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/191189/aeons-end/forums/0)
as well as on the [offical discord channel](https://discord.gg/PvjcfPt).
